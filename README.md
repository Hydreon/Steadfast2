# Steadfast2 MineCraft PE Server Software

## Introduction

Steadfast2 is a project for backporting new Minecraft: Pocket Edition changes to older Pocketmine versions for better stability and performance, while retaining as many features from the new versions as possible. It's currently in production on Lifeboat Survival Games' main servers.

## Known bugs

- Players don't fall out of the world naturally, you'll want to handle PlayerMoveEvent as needed to kill them.
- Chunks won't load, you will want to go to server.properties and set auto-generate value as on.

## Installation

### Installing On Linux/MacOS

To install SteadyFast on Linux OS/MAC OS please follow the instructions below.

1)  `git clone git@github.com:Hydreon/Steadfast2.git` or `https://github.com/Hydreon/Steadfast2.git` in directory of your choosing. Or download and extract the zip into the directory of your choosing. 

2) Navigate to `Steadfast2` directory via command line

3) Run command `./installer` If successful this will create a `bin` directory with a special Php7 build in it and a `start.sh` shell script
    
4) Running `./start` for the first time will take through the setup wizard where and create the 2 main config files for your server `pocket####mine.yml` and `server.properties`    

### Installing on Windows

Steadfast2 is not the best suited for running on Windows and another fork of Pocketmine would be better for that. But don't worry steadyfast2 will still run on Windows OS with some lack of performance,

To install Steadfast2 on Windows OS please follow the instructions below.

1) To install Steadfast2 on windows OS, first you need to download the PocketMine PHP7 installer -> [from here](https://github.com/NotPocketMine/Windows-PocketMine-MP/raw/master/PocketMine-MP-x64.exe) "Always take caution when downloading binaries off the internet" :)

2) Next, you need to run the PocketMine installer then follow the instructions provide in the installer. 

3) Then you need to navigate to your user's documents file, and delete PocketMine-MP.phar.

4) Finally, you need to move Steadfast2.phar into the directory above and run start.cmd.

We suggest a Linux VM in the meantime.  We also suggest using Vagrant and picking a Ubuntu box -> [from here](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&sort=&provider=&q=ubuntu)

  Linux VM Notes: 
        
   - If using Vagrant have a config of `config.vm.network "public_network"` in the `Vagrantfile` should make your server discoverable from LAN.
